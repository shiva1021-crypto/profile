# 👋 Hi, I'm Shivaprasath! (aka Shiva)

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate **B.Tech IT student** at [Alliance University, Bengaluru](https://www.alliance.edu.in/), actively building innovative projects in **AI, Machine Learning, IoT, Cloud, and Full Stack Development**.

I've participated in national-level hackathons and built projects ranging from **self-driving cars** to **AI voice assistants** (like Jarvis!), **face recognition-based voting systems**, and **crop recommendation models**. I enjoy solving real-world problems through tech.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV  
- **Web:** Flask, Node.js, MongoDB, SQLite, Bootstrap  
- **Hardware:** Arduino Uno, Sensors, Embedded Systems  
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS (Basics), Docker (Learning), Git, GitHub  
- **Tools:** VS Code, Jupyter, Postman, Figma

## 🌟 Highlight Projects

🔹 **Face Recognition Voting System**  
Built a biometric voting system using facial recognition and fingerprint verification with voter detail display and real-time vote casting.

🔹 **Self-Driving Car (Hackathon Runner-up)**  
Used Arduino + sensors + ML for path planning and auto navigation.

🔹 **AI Voice Assistant (Jarvis-like)**  
Built a voice-enabled assistant using Python and Wolfram Alpha integration.

🔹 **Online Fuel Delivery App**  
A real-time fuel ordering app for travelers in case of emergencies.

🔹 **Student Performance Prediction**  
ML model to predict student grades based on attendance and internal marks.

🔹 **Crop Recommendation System**  
ML-based web app to suggest best crops based on soil and environmental conditions.
